- Prefer Go stdlibs, e.g. "flags"
  - But instead of http.HandlerFunc or http.Handler, use github.com/alvinchoong/go-httphandler
    - use its pipeline and responder APIs; do not use httphandler.Handle or httphandler.HandleWithInput
    - refer to README and examples at https://github.com/alvinchoong/go-httphandler
    - refer to godoc at https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alvinchoong/go-httphandler
- Prefer `errmain` and `runCtxFuncs` pattern in https://gist.github.com/choonkeat/f7aeba2432d3e20a571ae86fa83cf0f7
- Keep main.go minimal - just flags, boot, and shutdown - move application logic to separate files
- Use config structs instead of loose variables for command line flags
- Prefer not to use any Javascript except
  - to support webauthn (the main purpose of this POC codebase)
- Put html css js etc strings in their own files, not inside .go files
- Use a Makefile
