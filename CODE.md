- Prefer Go stdlibs, e.g. "flags"
  - But instead of http.HandlerFunc or http.Handler, use github.com/alvinchoong/go-httphandler
    - use its pipeline and responder APIs
    - do not use httphandler.HandleWithInput
    - refer to godoc at https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alvinchoong/go-httphandler
  - Prefer errmain and runCtxFuncs pattern in https://gist.github.com/choonkeat/f7aeba2432d3e20a571ae86fa83cf0f7
- Prefer not to use any Javascript
- Prefer shadcn for markup and styling
- Put html javascript strings in their own files, not inside .go files
- Use a Makefile
- Use config structs instead of loose variables for command line flags
- Keep main.go minimal - just flags, boot, and shutdown - move application logic to separate files
